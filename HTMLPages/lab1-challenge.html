        <P>A web designer is an individual that makes their living by designing and maintaining web sites. This is a field that has evolved extremely quickly over the past decade, but the fundamentals still remain the same. Any web designer must have a strong understanding of the HTML languague developed by Tim Burners-Lee in 1989. Since ots original development HTML has come a long way and has incorperated a multitude of new features. HTML allowed for the development of the world wide web and the explosive popularity of the internet!</P>
   
    
        <p>As HTML evolved, developers soon realized that the structure of web pages should be define uusing HTML, and the pages style, look and feel, should be defined separatly, thus the birth of cascading style sheets. Now developers use HTML to define what the information on the web page is, such as a heading content, article content, a paragraph, within the article, or footer content, etc. Cascading sheets were desinged to define the colors of the document, the size, margins, colors, positioning of the various elements of the web pages.</p>
   
    
        <p>About the time the HTML and the world wide web were hitting publice sector, PHP was being developed to make web pages a more powerful tool. PHP is a scriping languague that is written directly on the web page and interpreted by the web server which would send the final version of the web pageto the vistor's browser. About a year later,Netscape released the first version of javaScript, under the name Mocha which later became Livescript, and then Javascript. Javascript is also a scripting languague, but inlike PHP and lacks the ability to interact with a database, but still provides processing functionality to a web page. Web designers now days must not only be proficient in HTML and CSS, but a variety of scripting language as well. Even though HTML was the first language of the web, many more have come along, but it still remains the fundamentals structure thet the web page is built from.</p>
